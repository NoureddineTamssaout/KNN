# KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
is a machine learning technique where a data point's classification or prediction is based on the classes of its closest neighbors in the feature space. It employs a distance metric to measure similarity and assumes that nearby points share similar outcomes. KNN is non-parametric and instance-specific, requiring no explicit model training.
